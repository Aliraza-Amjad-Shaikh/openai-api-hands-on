# 🧠 OpenAI API Tutorial

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates multiple use cases of the OpenAI API, combining prompt engineering, text generation, image variation, and role-based AI behaviors. The goal is to explore and experiment with GPT models, DALL·E, and chat systems using Python in an educational and hands-on format.
